Methodology to integrate Aspen Plus with Activity Browser (AB) and utilizing both classical and quantum Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to optimize next-generation plant designs. 

# Quantum Computing Application for Mapping Outputs of an Aspen-Python-Activity Browser interface, assisted by Support Vector Machines

**Process System Engineering** has undergone transformative advancements since its beginnings in the 1970s. Computational methodologies and tools made it feasible to model and simulate complex industrial operations, including traditional chemical and sustainable ones, enhanced by process intensification, such as post-combustion carbon capture systems.

By implementing metamodeling strategies into complex process operations, we can reduce modelsâ€™ complexity and transform them into more manageable algebraic models. One effective way to achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency is by utilizing a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** metamodel. The emergence of **Quantum Computing** presents a new opportunity to integrate this methodology into broader optimization and decision-making frameworks. Implementing quantum **machine learning** algorithms could result in faster training, improved data point separation, and better generalization performance, which may challenge traditional data science methods.

**Python** introduces an innovative approach to accelerate process modelling, simulation, and **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** by integrating **Aspen Plus** with **Activity Browser**, a graphical user interface for the Brightway2 LCA framework. By conducting multiple sensitivity analyses in **Aspen Plus**, an automated interface is established to process the datasets generated from these simulations and to retrieve the corresponding inventories from the ecoinvent database. This integration generates preliminary **ReCiPE indicators** for the LCA, bridging the gap between process simulation and environmental impact assessment in a streamlined manner.

### By obtaining multiple LCA scenarios for the implemented background systems, the established advanced mapping algorithm can facilitate decision-making processes for optimal sustainable operating conditions. The goal is to compare the performance of a classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a quantum SVM. The methodology involves training an SVM model using *Python's scikit-learn package* to evaluate the performance of a classical method. To classify data using quantum computing, classical data points must be converted into quantum data points using a parametrized quantum circuit known as an *"ansatz"* or "quantum variational circuit". This process involves transforming bits into qubits. Similar to the layers in classical artificial neural networks, where parameters are tuned to minimize an objective function. Using quantum states, the *SVM Kernel* is built and trained as a classical SVM using *Qiskit packages* for quantum machine learning.
